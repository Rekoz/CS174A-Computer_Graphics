My animation is the earth orbiting around the sun, with a satellite moving around the
earth and a UFO floating above the earth. The satellite is also stretching its solar
panel and signal receiver while flying around the earth.

Hierarchies: The sun is at the center of the scene. The earth is the sun's child, orbiting
around the sun, while also orbiting around its own axis. The satellite and the UFO is the
earth's children. The satellite's solar panels and the signal receiver is the satellite
body's children.

Polygons: I drew two polygonals. One is the satellite's signal receiver, which is
composed of a square base and four sides facing outward. It is flat shading. The other one 
is the UFO's body, which is composed of 20 triangles that make a circle top and 20 sides.
It uses smooth shading, so the body looks sleek.

Texture mapped objects: The earth, the sun, the satellite body, and the solar panels of 
the satellite are texture mapped.
